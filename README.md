- 👋 Hi, I’m @luchkim
- 👀 I’m interested in Embedded Systems, GPU Programming, High Performance Computing, Cloud System Design, and Mobile App development in Kotlin.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects.
- 👋 Wait: I have private Repositories that I am working on, so public is not Everything ;)
